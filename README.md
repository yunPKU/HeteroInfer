# HeteroInfer
# Introduction
This is the homepage of HeteroInfer, a set of python files for the inference of transmission heterogeneity as well as other epidemiological parameters from a virus phylogeny. The input is a dated phylogeny (or genealogy), where leaves correspond to pathogens isolated from the infected and sampled hosts. 

The main output is the estimated amount of heterogeneity in transmissibility, i.e., the coefficient of variation of the transmissibility rate. Our 

tree which indicates who infected whom. Such reconstruction can be achieved by colouring the branches of the phylogeny using a separate colour for each host, and such that the subtree coloured in a given colour represents the evolution happening within the corresponding host. Changes of colours on branches therefore correspond to transmission events from one host to another.
