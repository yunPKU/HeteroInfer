# Introduction
This is the homepage of TransPhyloMatlab, a software package for the Bayesian inference of infectious disease transmission from a phylogeny. The input is a dated phylogeny, where leaves correspond to pathogens isolated from the infected hosts. The main output is a transmission tree which indicates who infected whom. Such reconstruction can be achieved by colouring the branches of the phylogeny using a separate colour for each host, and such that the subtree coloured in a given colour represents the evolution happening within the corresponding host. Changes of colours on branches therefore correspond to transmission events from one host to another.
