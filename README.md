# HeteroInfer
# Introduction
This is the homepage of HeteroInfer, a set of python files for the inference of transmission heterogeneity as well as other epidemiological parameters from a virus phylogeny. 

The input is a dated phylogeny (or genealogy), where leaves correspond to pathogens isolated from the infected and sampled hosts. The main output is the estimated amount of heterogeneity in transmissibility, i.e., the coefficient of variation of the transmissibility rate.  

# Tutorial 
If you are new to HeteroInfer, you can follow the file of "tutorial.docx" which should only take a few minutes to go through and describes the main functionalities of HeteroInfer, including simulating datasets, inferring the transmission heterogeneity given a phylogeny and several graphical representations.
